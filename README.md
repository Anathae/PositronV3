# PositronV3
 A upside-down, fast, portable, and compact 3D printer

Upside-down, compact, portable, and super fast 3D printer - Positron V3 has it all. A compact 3D printer that packs into a filament spool box, so you can take it anywhere you want. This design is looking at a 3D printer less like a stationary machine, but more like a powerful tool in a maker/inventor's tool kit. The printer deploys and folds up in less than 90 seconds, fits easily inside a bag, and prints at 200+mm/s.
